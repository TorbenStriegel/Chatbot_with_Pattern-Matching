# Chatbot_with_Pattern-Matching

## Project Overview
Chatbot_with_Pattern-Matching is a Java EE backend application deployed on Tomcat. It leverages pattern matching techniques and interacts with a database to generate relevant responses to user inputs.

This project was developed as a part of the Freiburg Seminar for Mathematics and Natural Sciences ([Freiburg Seminar](https://freiburg-seminar.de/)).

## What is Pattern Matching?
Pattern matching is a technique used to find and identify patterns within data. In the context of this project, it involves analyzing user input (such as text messages) to identify specific patterns or keywords that trigger predefined responses. These patterns and responses are often defined in a structured manner, allowing the chatbot to provide contextually relevant answers to user queries.

## What is Tomcat?
[Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is widely used for deploying Java EE (Enterprise Edition) web applications. Tomcat is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, managing servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages), and providing the infrastructure for Java web applications to run.

## Functionality
- Chatbot_with_Pattern-Matching uses pattern matching algorithms to analyze user inputs and identify patterns or keywords.
- It accesses a database to retrieve predefined responses corresponding to identified patterns.
- The chatbot generates and returns relevant responses to user queries.

## Getting Started
To deploy and run the Chatbot_with_Pattern-Matching application, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Tomcat**: If you haven't already, download and install Apache Tomcat on your server or local environment.

2. **Set Up Database**: Ensure that the required database is set up and configured. Update the application's database connection settings as needed.

3. **Deploy the Application**: Deploy the WAR (Web Application Archive) file of the project on your Tomcat server.

4. **Access the Chatbot**: Once deployed, access the chatbot through a web browser or client application.
